# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
*Chat Application with AI Assistant*

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Create a conversational AI interface that embodies **transparent collaboration** between humans and AI, prioritizing trust, speed, and productive partnership over simple command-response interactions.

### Product Positioning
A focused chat application for users who want productive AI conversations, not casual chatting. We optimize for **conversational velocity** and **transparent reasoning** rather than broad feature sets.

- **Friction in Conversation**: Slow interfaces that interrupt thought flow
- **Lack of Trust**: Users unsure when AI is "thinking," processing, or has limitations
- **Generic Experience**: One-size-fits-all chat interfaces that don't optimize for specific use cases

### Target User Needs
- **Fast, fluid dialogue** with minimal interface friction
- **Understanding of AI capabilities** and reasoning processes
- **Reliable, consistent interactions** that build trust over time
- **Control over conversation direction** and AI behavior
- **Professional-grade tool** for work and productivity
